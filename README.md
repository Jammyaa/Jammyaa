- 👋 Hello, I'm Chinh, a blockchain developer. I am striving to become a good expert in this field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve my programming skills in Rust and cosmwasm smart contract. I will also continue to learn and work more deeply with the Cosmos SDK. Recently, I learned more about Aptos' Move contract programming language - a new generation blockchain with high throughput.
- 💞️ My hobbies are reading, playing chess and relaxing with my lover. Yes, I love her very much.
