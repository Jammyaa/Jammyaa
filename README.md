- 👋 Hello, I'm Chinh, a blockchain developer. I am striving to become a good expert in this field.
- 🌱 I’m currently programming on Ethereum (EVM) and Cosmos. Recently, I learned more about Aptos and Sui's Move contract programming language - a new generation blockchain with high throughput.
- 💞️ My hobbies are reading, playing chess and watching Manchester United play. Yes, I love this club very much.
